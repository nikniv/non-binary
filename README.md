# Non-Binary Pride in GitHub Repository Languages

![Screenshot, showing JavaScript in yellow, EmberScript in off-white, Fortran in purple/violet, and Crystal in black](screenshot.png)


## Testing the programs

Yes, they all at least run, some even do something!

- `1-yellow.js` was tested in browser console, and then on <js.do>
- `2-offwhite.emberscript` was tested with the EmberScript editors on <emberscript.com>
- `3-purple.f` was tested using [JDoodle](https://www.jdoodle.com/execute-fortran-online)
- `4-blackish` was tested using [Compile & run code in Crystal](https://play.crystal-lang.org/)

## Prior Art

Idea shamelessly copied from [ticky/trans](https://github.com/ticky/trans) who shamelessly pinched it from [spacekookie/gay](https://github.com/spacekookie/gay)
